#Info:
The goal of this project is to make a fully function Maplestory Client in C# that is relatively close to the original (except without all the problems it has and what not).

Anyone is free to fork it and start from where I left off, or just watch as I continue to develop it. Yes I do admit there are delays sometimes, but do not worry, I am not planning on abandoning this project anytime soon.

As of 04/02/2016: This client has been reverted back to a nothing-ness state. I've decided to make my own "engine" as well as switch to DirectX.

Why DirectX and not OpenGL: Honestly I wanted to start with something I know, I don't FULLY know DirectX, but I do know it to a certain extent. OpenGL has given me problems in the past because of the way you have to create and place textures (using vertex and tex cords and what not) that honestly confused to the core, no matter how many resource and references and so called tutorials I looked into, I could not get a hold of OpenGL. So far DirectX hasn't really given me many problem, and yes I do know DirectX is not cross platform, but I must say that is not top priority for me right now. My prioities are to get this client up and running like the original ASAP. Not make it work on Linux, Mac, etc. Once I complete the client, then I start to make a SEPARATE client using OpenGL. Why separate? Well it's because some people like DirectX and some people client OpenGL, others like them both. So why not just make two different client for people to choose who they want to target? Some people would just want a client to make their own maps and classes and what not, other would want it just to do the same and play with their friend who buys Mac instead of a PC, and so on.

So those who would like a C++ client: go here (https://github.com/SYJourney/JourneyClient) this guy is actually pretty far, and it's very impressive in all honesty. Those who are willing to wait for a C#/.NET client, wait here for more updates.

Thanks and have a great day.

- Language: C#
- Build: VS2015 .NET Framework 4.6
- DirectX Version: 11 (was 9 before but a lot of stuff was not only decrecated, but also there wasn't many resources to learn from since most people are using 11 now)
